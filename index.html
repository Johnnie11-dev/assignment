        <h2>City Exploration</h2>
        <p>New York City has always fascinated me, and not just for the usual reasons like the Statue of Liberty or Times Square—though I’d definitely check those out too. What really draws me in is the idea of wandering through the Village, maybe stumbling into one of those tiny, old bookstores that smell like dusty paper and history. I’ve seen those old movies where people are packed into little jazz clubs, and I’d love to experience that, even if it’s shoulder-to-shoulder crowded. And honestly? I’m kind of obsessed with the idea of grabbing a hot dog from a street vendor, finding a random bench in a park, and just watching the world go by. It’s that chaotic energy of the city that pulls me in—the feeling that anything could happen at any moment. I’m not even sure if I’d like the subway, but I feel like I have to try it at least once. New York just seems like the kind of place where you’d have these weird, unforgettable little moments that stick with you forever.</p>

        <h2>Work and Volunteer Experience</h2>
        <p>Here is a summary of my work and volunteer experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volunteer Role 1:</strong> One of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had was volunteering at the City Food Bank. Every Saturday morning, I’d help sort donations—canned goods, fresh produce, and dry goods—into categories so they could be distributed efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Volunteer Role 2:</strong> Last summer, I noticed how much litter was piling up in our local park, so I decided to do something about it. I reached out to a few friends, and together, we organized a community clean-up day. </li>
            <li><strong>Volunteer Role 3:</strong> A few months ago, I started volunteering at a homeless shelter downtown. My main role was serving meals during dinner hours, but I also helped set up beds and organize donations.</li>
        </ul>
